# arudino_uno_scripts
Just some C++ files for controlling an arudino uno, following along with the projects manual.

JUST A NOTICE:

These files are saved as text files, which means if you want to use them with the arduino you'll have to save them with a different file extenstions (.cpp).

I should also mention that my circuitry may be configured slightly different to yours if you are following along with the arduino projects book, however this code shouldn't return any syntax errors.
